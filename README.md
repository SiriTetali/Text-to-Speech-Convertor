# Text-to-Speech-Convertor
This website creates a user-friendly web page where users can easily convert entered text to speech by selecting different voices. The styling enhances the page's visual appeal, and the JavaScript functionality integrates with the Web Speech API to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience.

The project combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality to create a user-friendly Text to Speech Converter web application. Users can input text, choose from available voices, and hear the entered text spoken aloud by the selected voice.
